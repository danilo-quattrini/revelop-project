# revelop-project
The idea of this project is to retrive from a public API some datas 
that are they are to these post that each of them contains:
- `userId`, `id`, `title`, and `body`.

The first task is to write a program in python that we call it [assignment_solution.py](assignment_solution.py),
that takes all the datas from the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts%60
